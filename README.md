About Bookr
===========
Bookr is a document reader for the Sony PSP licensed under the GNU General
Public License v2. At the moment it supports plain text, PDF, CHM, HTML, 
DJVU, PalmDoc documents.

Notes on usage of CHM:
- When you choose to open an CHM file, Bookr will try to extract the CHM content
to the cache folder (no need to extract later). The extracting job will be executing
in background if the CHM contains valid HHC file (table of content); otherwise
Bookr will try to extract all htm files first and open the index.htm file as
start page. In worst case, it will list all the htm files extracted. Then the
extracting thread will continue to extract all other files such as images, css...
So you may see pages with all images missing at first; but after the Memory Stick
LED light stop blinking (indicate 'extracting complete'), please refresh the page
to see the full content page.
- Bookr opens a Browser with 2 tabs: TOC and Content; please use SQUARE+L/RTRIGGER
to switch between them.

Install
=======
To install simply copy the Bookr folder to your Memory Stick \PSP\GAME folder. 

Optional CJK PDF Support
========================
In order to support Chinese, Japanese and Korean PDF documents an external font
pack must be downloaded and installed. Around 65MB of additional space is
required in your Memory Stick.

1) Download the file named cjk-fonts-1.zip from the following URL:
http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=149290&package_id=200753

2) Create the following folder in your Memory Stick, where X: is the drive unit
where your PSP is mounted:
X:\PSP\GAME\Bookr\fonts

3) Extract the contents of the cjk-fonts-1.zip file into the folder. The final
file structure must look like this:
X:\PSP\GAME\Bookr\fonts\Adobe-CNS1-UCS2
X:\PSP\GAME\Bookr\fonts\Adobe-GB1-UCS2
X:\PSP\GAME\Bookr\fonts\Adobe-Japan1-UCS2
